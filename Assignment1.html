   <h3>Artists</h3>
   <h4>Salvador Dalí</h4>
      <p>Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, <i>The Persistence of Memory</i>, was completed in August 1931. Dalí’s expansive artistic répertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.

   <h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee is the creator of the World Wide Web and director of the coordinating body for Web development, the W3C. Berners-Lee credits Vint Cerf and Bob Khan (who defined the Internet protocol (IP) that allows computers to exchange packets of information) with the invention of the Internet, but it was Tim Berners-Lee who created the most widely used part of the Internet, the part that we call the World Wide Web (often abbreviated "WWW" or called "the Web"). Its outstanding feature is hypertext, a method of instant cross-referencing. The introduction of Tim Berners-Lee's hypertext system revolutionized the way the Internet was used.</p>
